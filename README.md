# Productivity
simple beginner project.
Has 2 markdown editors from SimpleMDE. Top one saves its content on localstorage and resumes state when opened again. The bottom one resets after closing. 
Todo list also saves tasks after closing to localstorage. 
I only wrote html and css code. Necessary javascript for fucntioning buttons and saving content to local storage was generated from chatgpt.(I dont know javascript as of yet.)
